# The FeatureBox

I developped this plugin for my server, and wanted to share with the community if it can be useful to someone :P

## What does it bring?

4 things!
1) First of all, we wanted to have the possibility to use Riptide even when weather is clear. So I did a look-like Riptide enchant. To enable it, you need to add a Riptide enchant on your Trident and rename it "Poseidon".
2) Unused Killer Rabbit mob. I saw (inside the Java edition) that a Killer Rabbit was available as entity in the game. I added a natural generation for them.
3) Unused Illusioner mob. I saw (inside the Java edition) that an Illusioner was available as entity in the game. I added a natural generation for them.
4) Unused zombie horse mob. I saw (inside the Java edition) that a zombie horse was available as entity in the game. I added a natural generation for them.

## How to?

For the installation, nothing special excepted you need to add the .jar file into your plugins folder.

The plugin bring (of course) a default configuration, but you are free to update it (using the file or ingame).

### Commands

* `/featurebox reload` Permits you to reload the configuration if you changed the file when the server is running.
* `/riptidetoggle` Permits you to enable/disable the riptide feature.
* `/riptideforce <number>` Permits you to control the force of the custom riptide (be careful, it can be... really fast.)
* `/unusedtoggle <entity name>` Permits you to enable or disable the natural spawn of three entities: `rabbit`, `zombiehorse`, `illusioner`.
* `/unusedchance <entity name> <percentage>` Permits you to control the % of chance for the natural apparition of those entities.
